            <p>For movie entertainment you don’t have to go farther than Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy (for that matter Nolan’s The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar were all fantastic), The Lord of the Rings trilogy (extended edition only!), almost all of the Marvel cinematic universe (also Sam Rami Spider-man 1&2 though I appreciated Andrew Garfield in the Amazing reboots), Star Wars, (Rogue One and Solo were better than Ep 7/8), Star Trek (Wrath of Khan best Original series, First Contact best of TNG flicks, and the reboots were all enjoyable), Harry Potter and most Pixar to have a pretty good grasp of my taste. I will add that I’m a classics fan as well – namely a Hitchcock fan – Charade, To Catch a Thief, North by Northwest, Rear Window, Rope, Dial M for Murder etc. I love the acting chops of Carey Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly to name a few. And for good measure Abbot and Costello routines and the Road To movies with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. You just can’t say you’re a movie buff without appreciating the classics.</p> 

            <p>On the TV side of things Cristin and I almost never watch anything currently airing short of The Voice or America’s got Talent and similar. We tend to Netflix/Amazon Prime/Hulu it eschewing traditional cable (and its cost), entirely. We enjoy(ed) Stranger Things, Sherlock, The Big Bang Theory, The Great British Bake off, Psych, Bones, Gilmore Girls, Full House, Fringe, Star Trek (TNG) and Dr. Who(though our favorite doctor is still being debated). On my own some favorites are JAG, Farscape, Stargate SG-1 and Batman The Animated Series (excited for the incoming HD remaster). I do tend to appreciate BBC productions for their extended length and better dialog than the explosion/eye-candy heavy American TV. </p>
