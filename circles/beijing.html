            <p>Probably a cryptic icon for most of you – this was the logo of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
            Sport has played a very large role in my life. From gymnastics as a child and then to tennis
            but once I found the sport of Track Cycling that’s all she wrote. It turns out I had been living 30min
            from the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games velodrome. For those not initiated a velodrome is a circular
            banked track you race specialized bicycles on. They are traditionally constructed of concrete or
            wood and can be outdoors or indoors. Current requirements for World level competition is a 250m
            distance at the smallest point, however the shape and incline of the tracks are all variable
            and up to the builders.  The bikes use a single fixed gear meaning there is no coasting or
            shifting, they don’t have brakes and you only make left turns. The ‘84 Games track was demolished,
            but a world class, wood construction, indoor facility was built in its place.</p>

            <p>I was 13 when introduced to the sport and loved it immediately. The need for speed generated by one’s own power captivated me. Through surplus funds set aside from the LA Games for future athlete development, I got to participate for free rising in the ranks from local to a state level. Then went on to National Championship competition and from there Jr. World level ultimately getting picked to live and train in Colorado Springs at the Olympic Training Center facilities. During my career I’ve been to 16 different countries competing in places like Australia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Trinidad & Tobago, Italy, and Russia. I’ve raced at every level including Pan American Championships, Pan American Games, World Cups, World Championships and Olympic Games. I retired in 2009 at 23, (a story too boring to share here), and moved back to California to continue my schooling. Time passed and the National Track Cycling program moved from Colorado to the California velodrome facilities. Realizing I had unfinished business, I picked up the bike again at the very end of 2010. With the 2012 Olympics in London coming quickly, I managed to regain my previous fitness and surpass it in a short amount of time making the World Championship team three months after returning.</p>

            <p>Earning your nation quota spots at the Olympics is on a points system. It had since changed from my previous Beijing Olympics and it was possible to earn more individual event spots just by earning enough points through a team event. This was where the National Team focused our efforts and due to the makeup of our squad, I was often used for my flexibility within the team instead of being able to focus on what I did best. Ultimately, we just missed out on securing enough points as a team to earn the extra individual quota spots and had just a single position to fill.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the coach’s selection process didn’t fall in my favor and a teammate of mine was sent instead. Tough though the decision was, especially with my having previous Olympic experience, was tempered by the fact that my now wife was also a cyclist having moved from Houston, TX to be a part of the National Team. Our relationship began in the lead up to the London Olympics and even if I knew I wouldn’t make the London team I’d do it all again! I retired, for good this time, as soon as I got the news of the selection and was able to support Cristin through the next National Championships where she won, retired, got married, realized there were no take backs and resigned herself to a life of superhero movies and developer jargon.</p>
