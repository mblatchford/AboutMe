            <p>I come from a long line of Apple products. My grandfather was an engineer and saw something in Apple from the very beginning getting my family our first computer - an Apple IIe. I was fascinated with that machine, using 5.25” floppies and playing games on the retina-searing green dot-matrix display. I got my first laptop before I was even in junior high inheriting an old Powerbook 140, (glorious trackball and all), off a family member. I can remember stealing away into corners of the house to write a homework paper or play solitaire or having to stand at the counter near the phone jack on our first internet connection. AOL with a 56k baud modem – those were the good old days... </p>

            <p>Technology has amazed me, capturing my attention ever since I can remember. I had my hands on many different Apple products growing up and quickly became the geek in the family. I loved comparing specs of new computer models, was the first of my family to take the plunge on an iPod and first to own an iPhone. The Apple tradition my grandfather started more than 30yrs ago continues through me today.</p>

            <p>The desire to learn and work with computers quickly blossomed into following consumer technology in general and despite my Apple upbringing have been known to work with and build a few PC’s. Today, I see development as an outlet for creativity, problem-solving and requiring less math than hardware engineering ;) I am mostly self-taught – my degree, though relevant, is very broad and general and didn’t give me the hands-on skills for any given job. After six-months of job hunting without any traction I’ve come to Digital Crafts to learn specifics, build upon what I already have been exposed to, and prove to myself I too can be a capable developer. </p>
