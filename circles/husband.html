            <p>Now married more than five years, my wife Cristin and I have very much enjoyed doing life together. Having briefly met her acquaintance in sport a few times while young, we never would have guessed weâ€™d be spouses one day. Our adventure started in California, but we had the pleasure of traveling and competing together before retiring from sport back in 2012. We married and spent a few years in my stomping grounds of Orange County before coming out to Georgia to be near her family. Cristin has been amazing and patient, putting me through the last couple years of schooling, the fruitless job search and now the crazy coolness that is Digital Crafts. We look forward to the strong foundation Digital Crafts will provide me allowing us to start family and carve out our slice of the American Dream.</p>
