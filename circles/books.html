            <p>Growing up I was a voracious reader. I loved a good mystery or science fiction novel. (Fun fact: I was even a published author as a kid for a short story I wrote in a library contest). Staples were series like those of Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and Tom Swift. As I got older I dove into the vast Star Wars universe of novels, (of which I am counted an unhappy fan when Disney threw out the existing literary universe as being cannon. There is no doubt in my mind they would have made better movies too -The Thrawn Trilogy anyone??, but I digress…).</p>
            
            <p>Most recently I’ve found political thrillers to be my bread and butter. Past jobs and commutes have put me more into audiobooks and I’ve gone through Harry Potter, all David Baldacci titles along with some Tom Clancy, and Brad Meltzer amongst others. I grew up listening to Old Time Radio shows on AM radio like Dragnet, Suspense, Yours Truly Johnny Dollar and Gunsmoke so I’m also quite fond of dramatized programs. A favorite is the long running Adventures in Odyssey, but I’ve also found some great Dr. Who plays by the British Big Finish Productions and one can’t exclude the incomparable Radio Theatre of which the Father Gilbert Mysteries are my favorite.</p>
