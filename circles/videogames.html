            <p>Let’s face it, I’m still (and likely always will be) a kid at heart. I love me a good video game. From convincing my parents to finally let my brother and I get GameBoys to trading in and trading up from there through N64, GameCube and Wii Nintendo franchises have always held a special place for me. Mario, Zelda, and Metroid Prime properties have always been the bar for games. </p>
            
            <p>As I got older I branched out into an Xbox, then 360 and now a One X. Halo, Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, Spliter Cell, Call of Duty were all common place for me. On the Sony side I got into things with a slim PS2 that I actually got a small screen for and took with me overseas to play when not competing. I dabbled with a PSP for later trips and moved through a PS3 into the PS4 Pro I have now. I love Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank and the Uncharted series, but still hate the Dualshock controllers with a passion. I’m trying to justify the cost of a SCUF Vantage gamepad for a more Microsoft style layout, but not sure the wife will go for that.</p> 

            <p>Though obviously a console gamer, (I need more 1st party titles to justify a Switch but it’s close), I do a lot of PC gaming as well. While a moderate rig, (now getting pretty old), I found plenty of titles that didn’t make it to consoles or were just cheaper on Steam/Origin/GOG/UPlay etc. Anything from The Talos Principle, Portal or ShadowRun and modern XCOM games to Rocksteady’s Batman series, almost anything Lego, and the Tomb Raider reboots - I play a lot of different things.</p> 
            
            <p>To round out my fav’s I was ecstatic when the point-and-click genre found itself again, often flourishing on the iOS platform. The Book of Unwritten Tales are awesome, the older Broken Sword series, The Room series and Forever Lost are standouts to me. Oh and I can’t help but toss in an all-time favorite in the X-Wing / Tie-Fighter flight sims of the late 90’s. Great stories, awesome action – if anything needs a new title it’s this series. I could go on and on, but if you haven’t been put to sleep by now just hit me up and we can wax nostalgic together.</p>
