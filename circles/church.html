            <p>Church for Cristin and I is very important to us. Our faith is the foundation for all we do, how we approach life – our very worldview. We found Stonebridge a month or so after we moved to Georgia and it’s been our church home ever since. Located right on the Marietta Square, it has a neat historic vibe to the building, great worship and a solid lead pastor and staff. Church programs were big in my childhood, namely AWANA, and while Stonebridge doesn’t host a club (and Cristin and I don’t yet have kids), we have chosen to work within their youth ministry currently helping with the 1st and 2nd graders. The truth is I’ve always had troubles growing up. I tend to see these kids as peers and love interacting with the younger generations. If anyone ever wants to see if Stonebridge is right for them be sure to let me know and we’ll join you! (I promise not to act like a 6yr old.)</p>
